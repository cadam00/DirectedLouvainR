Description: Directed Louvain clustering for graphs, based on the algorithm of Dugué and Perez (2022) <doi:10.1016/j.physa.2022.127798>. It is an extension of the undirected Louvain clustering of Blondel et al. (2008) <doi:10.1088/1742-5468/2008/10/P10008>, but using directed modularity definition instead of the original undirected one.
